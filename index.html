			<ul>
				<li>a natrual language suggestions</li>

		<h3>Using the website</h3>
		<p>
			Use Chrome if possible.

			There are controls at the top to upload a json file (provided seperately) that contains the survey. Once that file is uploaded, the problem and suggestion should be populated. You can navigate through each problem or suggestions using the corresponding buttons. Use the checkboxes, dropdown, and textbox to fill out the survey. There are keyboard shortcuts for most of the operations (including rating).
			<br>
			Upon completion of the survey, click the export button at the top and send that file to me. Thank you!
