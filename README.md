# Survey on language dependent transient error

## About this Repository

This serves as the website to conduct the survey. The survey is divided into the `index.html` which contains the directions and `main.html` which has the actual survey. It is a single page which uses jQuery to navigate the survey and modify the survey-result file that the user will eventually export.

## Survey Directions

### Task
Initially you will be asked some questions related to your programming experiences. Then you are asked to take on the perspective of different users to see what type of help you would like to receive when you have a programming problem. Please complete the survey for each user type, even the ones you did not select best represent you.
Next, you will be presented with a student's work and erroneous/incorrect output on the left and a suggestion on the right. For each suggestion, there are three versions:
- a natural language suggestions
- a correction of similar code but different context domain (library members and books)
- a correction of similar code in the same context domain (students and classes)

The questions asked in this section are as followed:
- For a particular problem, were you able to recognize the fix to the erroneous/incorrect output?
- For each suggestion to a problem, rate it from 1-5, with 5 being the best. A good suggestion would help you figure out the fix to the problem.
- Optionally leave any comments you have about the particular problem or its suggestions. Or if there are any nuances the rating does not reflect.

Finally, you will repeat some of the initial questions having now gone through the students problems portion of the survey and taking that into account.
		
### Using the website
		
Use Chrome if possible.

You can navigate through each problem or suggestions using the corresponding buttons. Use the checkboxes, dropdown, and textbox to fill out the survey. For the main part of the survey, there are keyboard shortcuts for most of the operations (including rating) in parentheses.

Upon completion of the survey, click the export button at the top and send that file to me. Thank you!

YOU MUST EXPORT TO SAVE YOUR WORK. DO NOT CLOSE OR REFRESH THE PAGE BEFORE EXPORTING.
